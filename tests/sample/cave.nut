    (`INT. THE BAT CAVE (mostly CGI)`):
        (`LOTS OF TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING  A CGI PHONE BOOTH and THE MASSIVE CGI BAT COMPUTER a real QWERTY keyboard with CGI blinking lights ala Irwin Allen like this`)

        (`Camera pans THE BAT CAVE, toward the sound of BATMAN’s voice. Just as we pan past the PHONE BOOTH . . .`)

        (`NB: BATMAN is a costume - NO COPYRIGHTED NAMES ARE EVER USED.`)

 
        @BATMAN:
            (`offscreen`)
            `Hey Clark, can you cover my shift this weekend? I’m doing the Bike MS charity ride.`

        (`Camera lands on BATMAN who is speaking into a black TELEPHONE.`)
 
        @BATMAN:
            `Thanks, man. I owe you a solid. (hangs up, turns to camera, starts walking) So you heard I’m bicycling a batload of miles for Bike MS. I hope you are, too. I’m here to give you some tips, and tip number one is to use your computer to sign up.`


        (`Batman STOPS IN FRONT OF THE BAT COMPUTER - it’s quite a sight!`)


        @BATMAN:
            `You go to the Bike MS website and click Find a Ride - - - Ah, the Gotham Gear Grinder. Then you make an account so you can start your fundraising.`

        `BATMAN is walking through the Batcave toward the BLACK TELEPHONE.`

 
        @BATMAN:
            `Now that you’re signed up you will need a bicycle. Nobody cares if you can go 150 miles in your fancy car or your helicopter or your jet plane. If you don’t have a bike borrow one from a friend.`


        `BATMAN dials the TELEPHONE.`

 
        @BATMAN:
            `Hey Barry, it’s Bruce. I’m doing this Bike MS charity ride and I’m wondering if I can borrow your . . .`

        `Suddenly THE FLASH ZOOMS IN on a RED BICYCLE.`

 
        @THE_FLASH:
            `You’ll like this bike, Bruce. Sixty-four speeds and kevlar tires.`
 
        @BATMAN:
            `So your bike is fast?`
   
        @THE_FLASH:
            `Fast? Are you joking?`
    
        @BATMAN:
            `Joking is that other guy’s thing.`
   
        @THE_FLASH:
            `And wear some clipless shoes, like you wear when you hang from your ceiling.`
   
        `THE_FLASH zooms offscreen.`
    
        @BATMAN:
            `Hey!`
            ('to camera')
             `I wanted to ask him to sponsor my ride. . .`
   
        `THE_FLASH: zooms back onscreen.`
   
        @THE_FLASH: 
            <action: "looks over BATMAN">
            `And lose the cape. It’ll slow you down.`

    
        @BATMAN: 
            to @THE_FLASH `No way, Jitterbug. The cape is my thing.`

   
        @THE_FLASH:
            `Suit yerself, skeeter eater.`
   
        `THE_FLASH: zooms offscreen.`
   
        @BATMAN:
            `Hey!`
             (to camera)
             `It’s impossible to get the last word with that guy..`

   
    (`@BATMAN: TRANSITION`):
   
        `@BATMAN: is walking through the Batcave toward the BAT COMPUTER`

    
        @BATMAN:
            `The point of the ride is to raise funds for MS. Even if I was a billionaire - which I’m totally not - I’m just a regular guy - but even if I was a billionaire I’d still ask all my friends to support my ride. When you do a long bike ride people like to support you.`

        `@BATMAN: is walking through the Batcave toward the CG PENGUINMOBILE(?)`

    
        @BATMAN:
            `You can also raise funds by selling stuff you don’t need anymore . . . `
            <gestures to PENGUINMOBILE`
            pass

//NB: PENGUINEMOBILE IS BLACK AND WHITE. MAY LOOK LIKE A DUESENBERG WEARING A TOP HAT.
    
        @BATMAN:
            `I got this from a guy who’s gonna be away for fifteen to twenty. I think I can get big bucks for it on eBay. But if you don’t have anything to sell, sometimes a local bar will let you do a celebrity bartender night . . .`

   
    <TRANSITION "!BATMAN">:
   
        `@BATMAN: is sitting at a bar. An nearly empty TIP JAR is prominent in frame.`
    
        @BATMAN:
            to @bartender `I’ll have tonight’s drink special. (to camera) I always support anyone who does a fundraiser, whether they ride with me or even another team.`

    `Camera pans behind the bar where JOKER is mixing drinks.`
    
        @JOKER:
            <action: "pushes steaming drink toward BATMAN">
            `I call this a Dark and Arkham. Forgive me if it tastes a little funny.`

   
        `@BATMAN: takes a sip and . . . CG + SOUND FX`
    
        `@BATMAN: is sprawled on the floor, but smiling. Camera tilts up to JOKER`
   
        @JOKER:
            <action: "to camera")
            `I finally put a smile on his face!`
   
        <TRANSITION "!BATMAN">

            Camera pans across empty barroom. We hear BATMAN and JOKER singing together, offkey.

            `He’s a devil! He’s a devil!`
            `He’s a devil in his own home town!`

        `Camera lands on them. They are side by side, swaying as they sing. TIP JAR is full.`
   
        [@BATMAN @JOKER]:
            `On the level! On the level!`
            `He’s as funny as a clown!`

        @BATMAN:
            `One major effect on your ride is the weather. No one can control the weather. Or can they? . . . hang on . . .`


            `Dials telephone.`
    
        @BATMAN:
            <action "to phone">
            `Hello? Diana! I didn’t know you would be in the office today. (mouths to camera “yes I did”) Can you look up something for me? Does anybody have a weather control machine? . . . Our team, their team, doesn’t matter . . . No? No weather control machines? Good. This weekend I’m riding for Bike MS. You should totally sponsor me. Yeah? So how about dinner after the ride? Sunday night. Great! (quietly) Bring your lasso.`

        @BATMAN:
            (hangs up, turns to camera)
            `So I was right, no one can control the weather. It’s going to be hot and sunny this weekend, so I’ll bring lots of water and, uh (looks at his black cape) sunscreen.`

        `@BATMAN: is walking through BATCAVE. We see the RED PHONE and BLACK PHONE.`
   
        @BATMAN:
            `Another thing about your ride . . .`

        `Suddenly the RED PHONE starts FLASHING! Alarms klaxons are sounding!`

   
        @BATMAN:
            (looking upward) 
            `Alfred, could you get the phone?`
            (to camera) 
            Oh guano, he’s off today.
    
        `@BATMAN: lunges for RED PHONE, but the klaxon and flashing light have already stopped.`
   
        @BATMAN:
            (to camera)
            `Oops. Went to voicemail. As I was saying, another thing that can affect your ride is trains. You don’t want to dash across the tracks in front of an oncoming train. You can’t control the weather but you can control the trains. I’ll show you how.`
   
        @BATMAN:
            (PICKS up BLACK PHONE and dials.)

   
        @BATMAN:
            (to phone in Bruce Wayne voice)
            `Casey? This is Bruce.`
            (to camera in BATMAN voice)
            `It’s okay, he lets me do this.`
            (to phone in Bruce Wayne voice)
            `’ve got a friend doing the Bike MS ride this weekend and he needs to cross a lot of your train tracks. Could you . . . ? No, I don’t know the route yet. Maybe you could just stop all the trains everywhere until Monday? Thanks, Casey. We’ll have you and the missus up for drinks sometime. Bye. `
            (hangs up)

            (to camera in BATMAN voice) 
            `See? That’s how you can take care of trains.`
