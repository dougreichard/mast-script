<p>I'm stepping through the door</p>
<p>And I'm floating in a most peculiar way</p>
<p>And the stars look very different today</p>

<p>Am I sitting in a tin can</p>
Far above the world
<p>Planet Earth is blue</p>
And there's nothing I can do
<p></p>
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
<p>I'm feeling very still</p>
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
<p>Tell my wife I love her very much</p>
<p>she knows</p>

<p>Far above the moon</p>

<p>And there's nothing I can do</p>
